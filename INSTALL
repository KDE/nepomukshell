BUILDING NepomukShell
=====================

Nepomukshell's build system uses cmake.
So to compile Nepomukshell first create a build dir (cmake does not support
building in the source dir):

  mkdir build
  cd build

then run cmake:

  cmake ..

(a typical cmake option that is often used is: -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<prefix>)

Nepomukshell then presents a configuration summary. At this point you may
want to install missing dependencies and run cmake again.

Finally build Nepomukshell:

  make

And install it (in most cases root privileges are required):

  make install
